# RxData ![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/license/revolut-mobile/RxData) ![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)

RxData is Android mobile library for building reactive data flow in Android application.

## Installation

Gradle is the only supported build configuration. Since 1.4 RxData is hosted on mavenCentral, 
in order to fetch the dependency, add the following lines to your project level `build.gradle.kts`:

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

And then to the module level `build.gradle.kts`:

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.revolut.rxdata:dod:1.4'
    implementation 'com.revolut.rxdata:core:1.4'
    implementation 'com.revolut.rxdata:scheduler:1.4'
}
```

You can add only the necessary modules. Core would be required everywhere for defining interfaces 
and working with models, but core only needed in data layer, where you are going to be implementing 
DataObservableDelegate. 

Scheduler is completely optional library for Android modules. 

## Examples

You can find several examples of how RxData is used in Revolut application [in this Revolut Tech article.][1]
Also, fully documentation TBD soon [here.][3]

Here is the exemplary code that get you started in your application:

```kotlin
private val observePortfolio: DataObservableDelegate<Any, String, Portfolio> = DataObservableDelegate(
    fromNetwork = {
        tradingService.getPortfolio()
            .flatMap { portfolioDto ->
                getConfig().map { stocksConfig -> portfolioDto.toDomain(stocksConfig) }
            }         
    }

    // You can define other network / memory / storage lambdas here
)
```
